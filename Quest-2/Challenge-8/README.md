# I have 3 files what do I do???

Deploy server.py somewhere. You can use pythonanywhere for example or any other hosting provider that supports flask.

Then grab the domain from the host you use and modify main.py to that domain.

Once you've modified main.py with your domain and keys you are ready to solve the challenge.
